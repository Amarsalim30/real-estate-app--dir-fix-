## **The Big Picture: Where You’re Headed**
Your time at Techbiz is a golden opportunity to build skills, confidence, and connections that will carry you toward your 2027 graduation and beyond. Here’s the game plan:
- **Short-Term (Now to End of Techbiz Attachment)**: Polish your Real Estate App to prod-grade, start learning Flutter, and lay the groundwork for your mom’s catering app.
- **Medium-Term (Next Year at TUM)**: Build a standout portfolio with projects like the catering app, deepen your tech skills, and grow your network.
- **Long-Term (By 2027 and Beyond)**: Use your experience to land a solid IT job or freelance gigs, setting the stage for your own business and financial goals like owning a home.

I’m going to guide you through what to do **right now**, sprinkle in things you didn’t know you needed, and keep you grounded with realistic advice. Let’s get to it.

## **Step 1: Finish the Real Estate App Like a Pro**
Abdulrahman’s advice to make your work prod-grade is your north star. Your Real Estate App (68% done) is a great start, but it needs to shine to impress your Techbiz team and boost your confidence. Here’s how to take it from half-baked to something you’re proud of.

### **Action Plan**
1. **Assess and Prioritize (This Week)**:
   - Open your app and test it as if you’re a user (e.g., a homebuyer). Note what works and what doesn’t. Examples:
     - Does the search function return the right properties?
     - Are there bugs when you click buttons or submit forms?
     - Is the design clean, or does it look messy on different devices?
   - Make a list of 3–5 things to fix or add to make it prod-grade. For example:
     - Fix any crashes or errors.
     - Add a missing feature (like a filter for property prices).
     - Improve the UI (e.g., better spacing, colors, or fonts).
   - If you’re stuck, compare it to Faiz’s real estate app for inspiration (but don’t copy!).

2. **Tackle Fixes (Next 2–3 Weeks)**:
   - **Frontend (Next.js)**: Focus on usability. Make sure the app looks good on both mobile and desktop. Use free tools like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for quick styling if you’re not already.
   - **Backend (Spring Boot)**: Check that data saves correctly (e.g., property listings or user inputs). Add basic error handling—like showing a message if a form is incomplete.
   - **Test Rigorously**: Try breaking the app (e.g., enter weird data). Fix anything that crashes.
   - Work in small chunks: 1–2 hours a day after Techbiz tasks. Set a goal, like “fix the search bug by Friday.”

3. **Get Feedback (Week 4)**:
   - Show your updated app to Abdulrahman or Faiz. Say something like: “I’ve been working on making the app prod-grade based on your advice. Can you take a look and suggest what’s still missing?”
   - Be open to criticism—it’s how you grow. If they point out flaws, thank them and fix them.

4. **Document It (Ongoing)**:
   - Add this project to your GitHub with a clear README (explain what it does, how to run it, and what you learned).
   - This will be a star in your portfolio when you apply for jobs or pitch your business later.

### **Why This Matters**
Finishing the Real Estate App to a high standard proves you can deliver. It’ll impress your Techbiz team, boost your skills, and give you confidence to tackle the catering app. Plus, it’s a concrete example to show future employers or clients.

## **Step 2: Start Learning Flutter for the Catering App**
You’re inspired to dive into Flutter for your mom’s catering app, and that’s a brilliant move. Flutter’s cross-platform power makes it perfect for a small business app, and learning it aligns with Abdulrahman’s expertise. Let’s get you started without overwhelming you.

### **Action Plan**
1. **Set Up Flutter (This Week)**:
   - Install Flutter following the [official guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). It takes about an hour.
   - Set up an emulator (or use your phone) to test apps. If you hit setup issues, ask Faiz or check Stack Overflow.

2. **Learn the Basics (Next 2 Weeks)**:
   - Spend 1–2 hours a week on free resources:
     - [Flutter’s “Write Your First App” tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) (builds a simple app in ~2 hours).
     - YouTube: Watch The Net Ninja’s Flutter series or Flutter’s official channel.
     - FreeCodeCamp’s [Flutter Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-flutter-full-course/).
   - Build a tiny app (like a to-do list) to understand Flutter’s widgets and structure. Aim to finish this in 10–15 hours total.

3. **Plan the Catering App (Week 3)**:
   - Talk to your mom about her business needs. Ask:
     - What’s the biggest hassle in her daily work? (e.g., tracking orders, updating menus)
     - What do her customers want? (e.g., easy way to see the menu or order food)
   - Sketch a simple app design on paper or a free tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). Example features:
     - **Homepage**: Business name, logo, and a “View Menu” button.
     - **Menu Page**: List of dishes with prices (and photos if possible).
     - **Order Form**: Fields for customer name, contact, and order details.
     - **Contact Page**: Phone number or WhatsApp link for inquiries.
   - Keep it minimal to start—focus on 2–3 core features.

4. **Start Building (Weeks 4–6)**:
   - Use Flutter for the frontend. Start with a basic homepage (e.g., a logo and menu button).
   - For the backend, try Firebase (it’s simpler than Spring Boot for small apps). Follow a tutorial like [Firebase for Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) to store orders.
   - Build one feature at a time (e.g., menu page first, then order form).
   - Test it with your mom early—even a rough version—to get her feedback.

5. **Learn from Abdulrahman (Ongoing)**:
   - Ask him one specific question, like: “I’m starting Flutter for a small app. Any tips for making it smooth and user-friendly?”
   - Later, show him your progress and ask for feedback. He’ll likely share tricks to make your app look pro.

### **Why This Matters**
The catering app is more than a project—it’s a real solution for your mom and a chance to learn Flutter, a hot skill in Kenya’s tech scene. Plus, it’s a personal win that’ll keep you motivated and show you can build something people actually use.

## **Step 3: Maximize Your Time at Techbiz**
You’re in a goldmine of learning at Techbiz with pros like Abdulrahman, Faiz, Hassan, Habshi, and Umar. Here’s how to soak up every opportunity before your attachment ends (assuming it’s a standard 3-month internship).

### **Action Plan**
1. **Learn by Watching (Daily)**:
   - Observe how Abdulrahman builds Flutter apps or how Hassan tackles big government projects. Note their habits—how they debug, organize code, or talk to clients.
   - Pay attention to Habshi in stakeholder meetings. His ability to explain tech to non-tech people is a skill you’ll need for your future business.

2. **Build Connections (Weekly)**:
   - Strengthen your bond with Faiz. Since you’ve already connected over Kali Linux, ask him about his cybersecurity certificates or his real estate app. Example: “Hey, how did you pick which CISCO course to take?”
   - Chat with Abdulrahman briefly. Maybe: “Your Flutter work is inspiring. How did you get so good at it?”
   - Update Umar on your Real Estate App progress. He’s the project manager, so showing initiative will make you memorable.

3. **Ask Questions (Ongoing)**:
   - Don’t be shy—ask one thoughtful question a week. Example: Ask Hassan how he handles tight deadlines on government projects. It shows you’re eager to learn without taking too much of their time.
   - If you’re stuck on your app, ask Faiz or Abdulrahman for a quick tip. Introverts shine in one-on-one convos, so use that to your advantage.

4. **Document Everything (Daily)**:
   - Keep a notebook or Google Doc with what you learn—code snippets, debugging tricks, or advice from the team.
   - This will help you review later and look impressive in job interviews or when pitching your business.

### **Why This Matters**
Techbiz is your chance to learn from real-world pros and build a network that’ll help you post-2027. These connections could lead to job offers, mentorship, or even partners for your future business.

## **Step 4: Balance School, Techbiz, and Side Projects**
You’re juggling TUM classes, your Techbiz attachment, the Real Estate App, and the catering app idea. That’s a lot, but you can handle it with a plan.

### **Action Plan**
1. **Create a Schedule (This Week)**:
   - Block out your time:
     - **Techbiz Hours**: Focus on their tasks and the Real Estate App.
     - **Evenings**: 1–2 hours on Flutter or the catering app (3–4 days a week).
     - **Weekends**: Catch up on TUM assignments and one bigger project task (e.g., finish a feature).
   - Use a free tool like Google Calendar or Notion to stay organized.

2. **Avoid Burnout (Daily)**:
   - Take 15-minute breaks during study or coding sessions to clear your head.
   - Do something fun daily—play a game, watch a show, or chill with friends. It keeps you sharp.
   - Get enough sleep. Those sleepless nights you mentioned? They’re okay sometimes, but regular rest makes you more productive.

3. **Track Progress (Weekly)**:
   - Every Sunday, write down what you accomplished (e.g., fixed a bug, learned Flutter widgets).
   - Celebrate small wins—it keeps you motivated.

### **Why This Matters**
Balancing everything now builds the discipline you’ll need as a professional or business owner. Plus, staying healthy keeps you sharp for the long haul.

## **Things You Didn’t Ask For (But Need to Know)**
As your pilot, here’s some extra wisdom to keep you soaring:
- **Your Introversion Is a Strength**: You don’t need to be loud like Hassan or Habshi. Your focus and thoughtfulness (like connecting with Faiz over Kali Linux) are your edge. Keep building relationships quietly but intentionally.
- **Cybersecurity Could Be Your Niche**: Your Kali Linux experience with Faiz is a spark. Cybersecurity is huge in Kenya (think M-Pesa, government systems). Consider a free CISCO course like Faiz did—it could set you apart.
- **Think Like an Entrepreneur Now**: The catering app is a mini-business. Treat it like one—ask your mom what her customers want, test the app, and iterate. This mindset will prep you for your bigger business dreams.
- **Failure Is Your Teacher**: If the Real Estate App or catering app has bugs, don’t stress. Every pro (like Abdulrahman or Hassan) has failed a ton. Learn, fix, repeat.
- **Save Early**: Even if it’s just 100 KES a week, start saving now. It builds the habit you’ll need to buy that home one day.

## **Your Chances of Success: A Realistic Look**
You asked for a reality-based view of your chances, so here it is:
- **Strengths**: You’re proactive (building an app in month two!), learning hot skills (Next.js, Spring Boot, Flutter), and surrounded by pros at Techbiz. Your TUM degree and attachment give you a solid base.
- **Challenges**: Tech moves fast, and staying relevant means constant learning. Your introversion might make networking tougher, but you’re already connecting with Faiz, so you’re on the right track. Time management is another hurdle—school and projects can pile up.
- **Outlook**: If you follow through on the Real Estate App and catering app, keep learning, and build a portfolio, you’re in a great spot to land a job or freelance gigs by 2027. Starting a business and owning a home are realistic but will take a few years of steady work. Your hustle and heart (like building an app for your mom) give you a real shot.

## **Your Immediate Next Steps (This Week)**
Here’s what to do right now to keep the momentum going:
1. **Real Estate App**: List 3–5 things to make it prod-grade. Pick one to tackle by Friday (e.g., fix a bug or add a feature).
2. **Flutter**: Install Flutter and run the sample app from their “Get Started” guide. Spend 1–2 hours playing with it.
3. **Catering App**: Talk to your mom about her business needs. Write down 2–3 features her app should have.
4. **Techbiz**: Ask Faiz one question about his cybersecurity certificates or Abdulrahman about Flutter. Keep it short and specific.
